-------- TODO --------
----------------------

* Reset entire program by pressing CTRL+r

* Only run pathfinding when r is pressed

* When pathfinding is not running and a path/open/closed is overwritten,
  remove the entire path, and try recalculating.

* When pathfinding is running, and pathfinding is overwritten, stop
  pathfinding and recalculate.

* Add a readme file.

-------- Done --------

* Add BSD license to the program.
