-------- TODO --------
----------------------

* When pathfinding is not running and a path/open/closed is overwritten,
  remove the entire path, and try recalculating.

* When pathfinding is running, and pathfinding is overwritten, stop
  pathfinding and recalculate.

* Add a readme file.

* The inevitable: Review comments 

* Find a way to go "directly" to the goal. Because you can move diagonally,
  it looks quite ugly. Maybe weight a diagonal move higher than a straight?

* Make it possible to step through the pathfinding.

* Reset with new grid size?

* Find a fix for a dual monitor setup.

* Because we can go diagonally, we actually end up searching too many fields,
  because too many have the same distance..

----------------------
-------- Done --------
----------------------

* Add BSD license to the program.

* Rename the main file to, whatever

* Only run pathfinding when r is pressed

* When a goal point is moved, recolour the old.

* Why is start colored wrongly when search has ended?

* Reset pathfinding by pressing CTRL+r

* Why are there fields left in open state, in the middle of closed states?

* Split the code into several packages

* Reset with CTRL+r doesn't entirely reset the pathfinding, from time to
  time it messes up, and won't start again

* Reset entire program by pressing CTRL+SHIFT+r

* Make it possible to not reset start/end points.
